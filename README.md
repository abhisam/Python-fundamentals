It's a terrific course for learning how to program, and also
terrific for experienced programmers who want to learn
the syntax of Python.

The videos and instructions are top notch. The assignments
are basic, but not simplistic, and does require a bit 
of work.

These are my solutions. They are verified to be correct. If
you're taking the course, I urge you to complete them
yourselves, as that is the *only* way to learn how to program.
